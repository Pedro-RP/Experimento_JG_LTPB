% fEEGsignals = filtEEGdata(EEGsignals,fs,low_cut,upper_cut)
%
% The function receives the matrix EEGsignals in which each line
% corresponds to the time series of a given channel and returns the
% fEEGsignals that presents the same signals, but filtered with a bandpass
% procedure.
% INPUT:
% EEGsignals =  a matrix whos dimensions are channels and samples.
% fs = sampling frequency
% low_cut = frequency to be used in the high-pass filter
% uppercut = frequency to be used in the low-pass filter
%
% OUTPUT:
% fEEGsignals = corresponds to EEGsingals filtered according to the given
% parameters.
